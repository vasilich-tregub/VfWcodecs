The MRLencode and MRLdecode samples are inspired by an SO post 
[**Is it possible to encode using the MRLE codec on video for windows under windows 8?**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22765194/is-it-possible-to-encode-using-the-mrle-codec-on-video-for-windows-under-windows)

It is a good introduction to both MRLE and VfW.
