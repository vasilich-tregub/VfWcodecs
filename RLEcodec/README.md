Like the code in MRLE folder, the RLEcodec codec project is also inspired by an SO post 
[**Is it possible to encode using the MRLE codec on video for windows under windows 8?**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22765194/is-it-possible-to-encode-using-the-mrle-codec-on-video-for-windows-under-windows)

It uses [**a code for run-length encoding borrowed from the Rosetta Code project**](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding/C).
